# Analyzing the Impact of Location on Housing Prices

## Description
The big question that drove my interest is: Can we predict a house price based on its area? In other words, I am interested in knowing how helpful is the area of the house in predicting the house price? Hence, I tried to tackle the question by exploring whether there is a correlation between the houses prices and areas. I also created a linear regression model to examine how much variation of houses prices can be predicted based on variation in houses area.

## Dataset
I obtained this dataset from kaggle datasets. In the original dataset, there are 19 house features along with the price and the id columns, and 21613 entries . Originally, there is information about houses built from 1900 till 2015, but this report analyzes only house prices in 2014 and 2015.
